# Expo Go: Asynchronous Operation Errors During Unmount

This repository demonstrates a common error in Expo Go applications related to asynchronous operations and component unmounting.  The error often manifests as a generic JavaScript error or a blank screen, making it difficult to debug.

## The Problem

When asynchronous operations (e.g., network requests, timers) are initiated within a component that's subsequently unmounted, the operation might still be in progress.  If the operation attempts to update the component's state after it has been unmounted, an error can occur.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `expo start`.
3. Observe the error in Expo Go.

## Solution

The solution involves using cleanup functions (e.g., `useEffect` cleanup function in React) to cancel or ignore the asynchronous operation when the component unmounts.  This prevents state updates after the component is no longer active.
