This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your application, particularly when dealing with asynchronous operations or navigation.  The error message itself isn't always descriptive, often presenting as a generic JavaScript error or a blank screen.  The root cause frequently lies in improper handling of asynchronous code within a component that's being unmounted before the asynchronous operation completes.
